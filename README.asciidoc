__Opinionated, Functional Options Manager for Vim__

TIP: If you like Optimal and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for

NOTE: The __functional__ code hasn't been written yet. Suggestions welcome.

== Opinionated

**Optimal** locks the following options by default:

* `edcompatible`
* `gdefault`
* `magic`
* `remap`
* `smartindent`
* `tabstop`
* `textauto`
* `textmode`

== Synchronisable Options

  call optimal#sync(['sw', 'sts'])

Will keep these options in sync. Whenever a change is made to one of
them, the associated options will be set to the same value.
